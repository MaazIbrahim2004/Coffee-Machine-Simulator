# Coffee-Machine-Simulator
This is a simple Java-based application that simulates the functionality of a coffee machine. 
The application allows the user to perform several actions such as buying a coffee, filling the machine with resources, 
taking the money from the machine, checking the current state of the machine, and exiting the program.

# Features
The application simulates a coffee machine with the following operations:

* Buy: Allows you to buy a coffee. There are three types of coffee available: Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino. Each requires different quantities of water, milk, coffee beans, and cups. If there aren't enough resources to make the coffee, the machine will let you know.

* Fill: Allows you to fill the machine with more resources. You can add water, milk, coffee beans, and coffee cups.

* Take: Allows you to take all the money that's currently in the machine.

* Remaining: Displays the current state of the machine. It shows the amount of water, milk, coffee beans, and cups left in the machine, as well as the money collected.

* Exit: Stops the machine.
